# How can I scale experts by tuning foundational NLP models?

# Questions

1. What are the best readings?
2. What are the best tools?
3. Can intergrating a causal inference DAGs be an innovation?
4. What are my bottlenecks (cost, complexity, time, traction)?

# High priority TODOs

- [ ] Google Ad experiments to a landing page
- [ ] [Read OpenAI Getting started and docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction_
- [ ] Read all of Snorkle's readings and examples 

# Low priority TODOs

# Toy PoCs

- Can ChatGPT do causal inference? Use Book of Why? (J. Pearl) firing squad text. Add causal DAG and then repeat.
- Is this dish Keto?
- Is this sentence VAGUE?
- Re-do my past consulting work - Does this invoice line relate to a ADMIN task?   
- Is this article relevant to me to read?

# Consulting 

### Potential Google Ads Promotional ideas 

- We are looking for companies whose AI project is stuck because of garbage input data.
- Bad prediction performance can't be fixed with sophisticated ML R&D when the training data is garbage.
- garbage in, garbage out
- labeling quality
- does your pipeline require heavy manual work before data releases?
- lots of labeling but still poor predictions?
- data quagmire rescue
- data pipelines get clogged with garbage input
- Mr CEO, How much $ have you burned on your AI project?
- if benchmark met, max you pay is .33 of what was burned b4 starting the project
- Free consultation
- Cost = 1/3 of the $$$ you have burned
- Don't contact us unless you have already failed.

- [Snorkle AI](https://snorkel.ai/) -- checkout videos from conferences
-- Programmatic Labeling
-- Foundational Models
-- Use Case Examples
- Data centric AI
- Get paid based on how far we beat benchmark
- Stuggling NLP
- C-suite level access needed to get traction
- Leveraging Foundational Model - Fine-tune
- Functions
- Weak labeling
- Weak supervision
