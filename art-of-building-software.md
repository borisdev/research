## Agile engineering to win the human powered helicopter flight challenge?

The whole helicopter was built like a house of cards, so when one
thing went wrong, the entire thing fell apart[2]. AeroVelo Inc. used agile
engineering to design parts that could easily be put back together after
breaking[2]. This helped them win the human-powered helicopter flight
challenge[2][3].

# My notes

- [My take on S.O.L.I.D principles](solid_principles.md)

# cognitive load theory and making software

- extraneous cognitive load versus other types
- confusing extraneous cognitive load for intrinsic load to learn
- naming to reduce
- interface to reduce
- always putting our fire, can't make the design leap
- hidden scripts
- layers of abstraction that obfuscate 
- No reward for tiny actions to reduce load versus being system debugging hero
- Design documentation
- Communication with same language
- The "craft" of software


# Data side versus algorithm side 


- finding alpha - economic value from re-conceptualizing what the data means
- risky (engineering) versus frisky (data side)
- represent info value via data structure - simplification 
- enormous cognitive load up front to reduce long term load ...the sorting for BIG O problem for the human brain... 
- ROI
- Data design to reduce cognitive load and scale humans
- A computational model of human cognitive load

# The dilemma 

Make a link to Loonshot book's theory

- questioning will come at the cost of the perception of execution speed at the
  benefit of avoiding the XY problem and making a Rube Goldeberg machine -- this
  will be hard without circumventing the conventional hierarchy that instills
  fear to keep the perception of execution speeds high.

# Raymond's lessons

Raymond's lessons for creating good open source software[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Lessons for creating good open source software")]

1.  Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
2.  If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
3.  Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
4.  To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
