## Core values 

### Distilling Zillow's eight core values into three parts

1. The View - Purpose - customer
2. The Practice - have an open state of mind - put on the light - use all information
3. The Conduct - two balancing trilemmas
    a. balance - trilemna - speed, quality, ethics
    b. balance - autonomy, interdependence, individuality
