# The Pitch

## Objective

I want to check if you and Brad are curious about probing the idea of creating
a consulting firm to fine-tune LLM for big companies?

## Now the timing is special

A few months ago, Sam Altmanâ€™s (CEO of OpenAI) said he expects that the next
unicorns will focus on fine-tuning models for various verticals
([interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHoWGNQRXb0)).

[This paper](README.md) explains how fine-tuning large LLMs will fundamentally restructure text classification projects at companies.

A consulting business can exploit this restructuring.

## Risks

### 1. How can we compete against a prospective customer's internal ML team?

Here are some hypotheses.

- Its too costly for a big company to quickly restructure as required by the AI new tech.
- A company's internal ML team will not propose to make a PoC with the new AI tech model because its against there interests.

### 2. How can we compete against other consulting companies?

Here are some hypotheses.

- Its too early for other fine-tuning consulting firm to have sprouted.
- Shawn has credibility working with SMEs
- Brad has credibility with other CTOs and venture firms. 

## What's the exit plan?

After developing an agile knowledge process for tine-tuning LLM, human experts,
and tooling, we can sell the startup to a big consulting firm.

## My goofy ask regarding the next step

Would Brad and you consider using your names to make the following experiment.
In order to probe demand out there I would make a company landing web page with
your names, then have Google Ads and a co-authored Medium article with you, based on
[this paper](README.md), targeting that landing page.
