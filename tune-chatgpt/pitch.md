# The Pitch

## Objective

I want to check if you and Brad are curious about probing the idea of creating a consulting firm to fine-tune LLM for big companies?

## Now the timing is special

A few months ago, Sam Altmanâ€™s (CEO of OpenAI) said he expects that the next unicorns will focus on fine-tuning models for various verticals ([interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHoWGNQRXb0)).

To keep a their businesses competitive, CTOs must now adopt a new technology that changes their AI development model. Specifically, fine-tuning ChatGPT makes these two components of an AI project become obsolete.

1. NLP experts working in NN architecture
2. human annotation

## Two riskiest assumptions to the consulting business model

### 1. What about our customer's internal AI teams as competition?

Although a quick PoC will be the sufficient evidence to persuade CTOs that they must change their AI development model, why would a company's CTO to hire us over their own ML internal team to make a PoC?

Here are some hypotheses.

- A company's internal ML team will not propose to make a PoC with the new AI development model because its against there interests.
- Its too early. The concept of an analyst-SME fine-tuning team is too new. See my paper explaining the concept of a SME-analyst fine-tuning team.
- Over time an internal analyst-SME fine-tuning team will never be able learn as quickly as a extenal consulting team that works with many clients. This depends on us developing a agile knowledge process.

### 2. What about other consulting companies as competition?

Why would a company's CTO to hire us over other consulting companies to make a PoC? What else is our special sauce? 

Here are some hypotheses.

- There might be more demand than supply?
- We have talent and experience working with SMEs (cognitive empathy and technical know-how). 
- We have credibility with other CTOs and venture firms. 
- We can get a jump start on the competition because we don't have jobs.

## What's the exit plan?

Sell knowledge base of processes and tooling to a big consulting firm.

## Next step, and the ask

Would Brad and you consider me probing demand by creating a Google Ads and a Medium article targeting a company landing web page with your names?
