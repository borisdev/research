# The Pitch

## Objective

I want to check if you and Brad are curious about probing the idea of creating
a consulting firm to fine-tune LLM for big companies?

## Now the timing is special

A few months ago, Sam Altmanâ€™s (CEO of OpenAI) said he expects that the next
unicorns will focus on fine-tuning models for various verticals
([interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHoWGNQRXb0)).

To keep a their businesses competitive, CTOs must now adopt a new technology
that changes their AI development model. Specifically, fine-tuning ChatGPT
makes these two components of an AI project become obsolete.


1. NLP experts working in NN architecture
2. human annotation

[This paper](README.md) goes into more detail.

explaining the concept of a SME-analyst fine-tuning team.

## Questions on risky assumptions

### 1. How can we compete against a prospective customer's internal ML team?

Here are some hypotheses.

- A company's internal ML team will not propose to make a PoC with the new AI development model because its against there interests.
- Its too costly to change their organizational structure. [This paper](README.md) explain the organizational change needed.

### 2. How can we compete against other consulting companies?

Here are some hypotheses.

- Its too early for other fine-tuning consulting firm to have sprouted.
- Shawn has credibility working with SMEs
- Brad has credibility with other CTOs and venture firms. 
- We can get a jump start on the competition because I am not working for a few weeks.

## What's the exit plan?

After developing an agile knowledge process for tine-tuning LLM, human experts,
and tooling, we can sell the startup to a big consulting firm.

## My big hairy, "going out on a limb" ask regarding the next step

Would Brad and you consider me probing demand out there letting me creating a
Google Ads and a co-authored Medium article targeting a company landing web
page with your names?
