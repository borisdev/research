* **Karma** (Sanskrit, also _karman_, Pāli: _kamma_) is a Sanskrit term that literally means "action" or "doing". In the [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist) tradition, _karma_ refers to action driven by intention (_[cetanā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetan%C4%81)_) which leads to future consequences. 
* A graph DB, social network analysis, input-output analysis MRIO matrix and the W matrix can all represent local economic relations that a fund wants to both target and analyze. These local economic relations can also be seen as karmic or sacred relations. can also do this. Geography is just a proxy for local relations we can’t see easily. Telephone numbers can also work. A crypto token can be used to pay for services at a much cheaper rate to people we have a karmic bond with. We share time equally among friends and at a much cheaper rate than with our work place. A special currency can be used to track how we share service time among local community members. Funds from outside can beef up the currency. 


# Hyper-local funding problem


## The problem 

How can you target funds to hit a specific community?


## A proposed solution

Provide a [Celo local token](https://celo.org/) that can be used to purchase goods and services within a community using just people’s cell phones using [ValoraApp](https://valoraapp.com/).

# The CDFI problem

Banks are ineffective in serving low income communities using Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI). Evidence is that they fail to distribute the money they have been allocated to provide for recipients of poor neighborhoods.

The problem is we need an alternative model to the CDFI for distributing allocated funds to poor neighborhoods.


# An alternative model to CDFIs using a DAO


## Economic incentives for recipients



* No collateral required
* Interest rate limits


## Economic incentives for funders



* Geographic constraint parameters
    * Define target census blocks to geo-target
    * x% of recipients must reside in geo-target 
    * y% of recipients new hires must reside in geo-target 
* Funder has flexibility in in how aid is paid back


##  \
Operational efficiencies



* Reports triggered only once threshold capital level met
