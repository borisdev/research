# How can generative AI increase diversity inclusion at companies?

## Why this question?

- generative AI is big for VCs
- diversity inclusion is huge for the C-suite 
- Alex has credability so people will open the door for him. This question is the entrypoint into gaining ground truth knowledge on a new landscape, leavimng the option open to pivot to a more profitable b-model from the knowledge spillover in the overlapping domains of collaboration and engagement.
- Obviously we are not going to catchup with the frenzy to build new cutting edge tech tools. But, my guess, is that the people at the cutting edge of building tech tools need a shortcut to quickly absorb domain expertise into their software models, beofre their competition (ie. absorb human mental models on emotion so they do not build something technically impressive but humanly meaningless..."No motion without emotion".)
- You (we) will be paid by the well funded startups or be a partner.

## Sequence of next steps, going backwards

1. Alex talks to CEOs.  
2. Publish a Medium article that gets to the eyes of C-suite, VCs, and start-ups.
3. Alex meets Heide Garder and Ivan Matviak authors of [Smarter Collaboration](https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Collaboration-Approach-Breaking-Transforming/dp/1647822742). Why these two: because they have already done what Alex is doing at a massive scale. 
  - He asks, How can generative AI increase diversity inclusion at companies?
  - Alex then asks them who he should talk to next and what questions he missed ask so he can iterate on a checklist of questions. 
2. Above depends on these prerequisites
   a. Alex getting in the door. So Alex beefs up his LinkedIn page with diversity.
   b. beef up on the theoretical frameworks of collabporation and inclusion and engagement. 
     - *Watch Out: Illusion of Inclusion*, chapter 10 in [Smarter Collaboration](https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Collaboration-Approach-Breaking-Transforming/dp/1647822742) 
     - others  to research?
   c. research competing tech tools
     - Microsoft Teams can flag in real-time exclusion
     - SWOOP has studies Microsoft Teams data -- I wonder what additional insights can be squeezed using the new AI
     - Yammer
