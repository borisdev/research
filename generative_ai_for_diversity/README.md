# How can generative AI increase diversity inclusion at companies?

## Why this question?

- diversity inclusion is huge for the C-suite 
- Alex had credability here in diversity inclusion so he people will open the door for him.
- generative AI is big for VCs
- This question is the entrypoint into gaining ground truth knowledge on the new landscape, not the rigid goal. We can always pivot out to a more profitable idea if it emerges in the overlapping domains of collaboration and engagement.

## Next step in order reverse dependency order

1. Alex asks the big question to Heide Garder and Ivan Matviak authors of [Smarter Collaboration](https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Collaboration-Approach-Breaking-Transforming/dp/1647822742) because they have already done what Alex is doing at a massive scale. Alex then asks them who he should talk to next and what questions he missed ask so he can iterate on a checklist of questions. Alex should talk to more CEOs.  
2. Above depends on these prerequisites
   a. Alex getting in the door. So Alex beefs up his LinkedIn page with diversity.
   b. Beef up on the theoretical frameoworks.
