# How can generative AI increase diversity inclusion at companies?

## Why this question?

- generative AI is big for VCs
- diversity inclusion is huge for the C-suite 
- Alex has credability so people will open the door for him. This question is the entrypoint into gaining ground truth knowledge on a new landscape, leavimng the option open to pivot to a more profitable b-model from the knowledge spillover in the overlapping domains of collaboration and engagement.

## Sequence of next steps, going backwards

1. Alex asks the big question to Heide Garder and Ivan Matviak authors of [Smarter Collaboration](https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Collaboration-Approach-Breaking-Transforming/dp/1647822742) because they have already done what Alex is doing at a massive scale. Alex then asks them who he should talk to next and what questions he missed ask so he can iterate on a checklist of questions. Alex should talk to more CEOs.  
2. Above depends on these prerequisites
   a. Alex getting in the door. So Alex beefs up his LinkedIn page with diversity.
   b. beef up on the theoretical frameoworks.

     - others ?
   c. research competing tech tools
     - Microsoft Teams can flag in real-time exclusion
     - SWOOP has studies Microsoft Teams data -- I wonder what additional insights can be squeezed using the new AI
     - Yammer
