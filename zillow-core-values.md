## Core values 

### Distilling Zillow's eight core values into three parts

The below three way split was inspired Buddhism.

1. The View - Purpose - customer
2. The Practice - have an open state of mind - put on the light - use all information
3. The Conduct - two balancing trilemmas
    a. trilemma to balance -> speed, quality, ethics
    b. trilemma to balance -> autonomy, interdependence, individuality

#### Trilemma: Balance of autonomy, team work, and individualism (diversity)
