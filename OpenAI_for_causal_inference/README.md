# Can OpenAI do causal inference?

## Experimental design

- Copy and paste contextual text from Book of Why? (J. Pearl) on the firing squad?
- Ask OpenAI inferences questions using counter factuals on whether the prisoner will die or not?
- Example inference questions
-- If the colonel does not give the order, will the prisoner die?
- Add a causal DAG and then repeat


## Misc ideas

- 2 groups are genetically insulin resistant but 1 group has much lower A1C ...why?

## proxies to experimental interventions

- Pima Indians article put in term of a DAG. And a political geo border being a proxy to a intervention.
- Holocaust paper by scientists of human physiology under extreme starvation
- Geo-political Instiutional factors
