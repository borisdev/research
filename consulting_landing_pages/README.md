# Notes

## promotional ideas 

- Offer human-in-the-loop ML 
- We are looking for companies whose AI project are stuck becasue of garbage input data - bad performance even with sophisticated ML
- Free consultation


## factors

- garbage in, garbage out
- labeling quality
- does your pipeline require heavy manual work before data releases?
- lots of labeling but still poor predictions?
- data quagmire rescue
- data pipelines get clogged with garbage input
- requires 
-- schema validation
-- pre-procesing noise filters
-- QA
-- exploratory stats



## Philosophy

-- questioning will come at the cost of the perception of execution speed at the beneift of avoiding the XY problem and making a Rube Goldeberg machine -- this will be hard without circumventing the conventional heirachy that instills fear to keep the perception of execution speeds high.
