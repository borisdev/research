# Consulting: Human-in-the-Loop annotation design for ML 

## Promotional ideas 

We are looking for companies whose AI project is stuck because of garbage input data.

Bad prediction performance can't be fixed with sophisticated ML R&D when the training data is garbage.

### Potential Google Ads

- garbage in, garbage out
- labeling quality
- does your pipeline require heavy manual work before data releases?
- lots of labeling but still poor predictions?
- data quagmire rescue
- data pipelines get clogged with garbage input

### Landing pages


### Misc ideas

- Free consultation
- Cost = 1/3 of the $$$ you have burned
- Don't contact us unless you have already failed.

## Success factors

- the story of past failure

## Tools

- A new process of using OpenAI to absorb SME and to reduce labeling ?
- pre-procesing noise filters like schema validation
- QA and QC
- exploratory stats

## People

- Robert
