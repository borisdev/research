ChatGPT geometric proof

```
Let A and B be two events such that P(A) > 0 and P(B) > 0.

Then, the probability of A given B is:

P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

Now, let's draw a Venn diagram to illustrate this.

Let A and B be two circles, with A being the larger circle. The intersection of A and B is the area of overlap between the two circles.

Now, the probability of A given B is equal to the area of overlap divided by the area of B.

Therefore, P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).
