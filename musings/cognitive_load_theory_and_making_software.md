- extraneous cognitive load versus other types
- confusing extraneous cognitive load for intrinsic load to learn
- naming to reduce
- interface to reduce
- always putting our fire, can't make the design leap
- hidden scripts
- layers of abstraction that obfuscate 
- No reward for tiny actions to reduce load versus being system debugging hero
- Design documentation
- Communication with same language
- The "craft" of software
