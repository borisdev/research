## Agile engineering to win the human powered helicopter flight challenge?

The whole helicopter was built like a house of cards, so when one
thing went wrong, the entire thing fell apart[2]. AeroVelo Inc. used agile
engineering to design parts that could easily be put back together after
breaking[2]. This helped them win the human-powered helicopter flight
challenge[2][3].
