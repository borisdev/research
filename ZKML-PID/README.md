# ZKML will be a new layer for enterprise web applications

In five years enterprise applications wll start using a new blockchain layer to get PID (personal information data) in order to train machine learning models to solve the precision, perosnalized prediction problem.

Imagine you can help your family by getting answers to these life changing questions.

- Tell me how children with the same genes as my child best survived the same chronic disease?
- Tell me how elderly with the same genes and biomarkers as my mom best reversed their dementia?
- Given my mom's elderly age and bad hearing, who is the best Uber driver?

People will pay a very high premium for these predictions. So why do enterprises not profit from developing machine learning models that make these precision, personalized predictions?

The blocker is that companies need personal information data (PID) to develop such precision predictions and people will not share PID until they see the benefits outweighing the privacy risks.

As a solution, in order to charge premium prices to the consumer for these precision predictions, enterprises will use a new PID blockchain zero-knowledge (ZK) layer in their application stack to provide the consumer with privacy protection and market incentives to share their PID. 


To solve big these human pain points AI prediction accuracy must move to the very granular subgroup level, and this requires 

- economic incentives and privacy for the data doners.
- cheap ZKP queries for the enterprise applications





## Rationale

Enterprise web applications need granular predictions to fill the void in high demand services for their customers. 

Granular predictions are not possible because of individual heterogeneity.

The only manner to solve this is to train ML models with private or PID data.

This does not happen because people will not reveal private data. They do not see the gain in prediction as worth the risks they foresee for the loss in privacy.

The world is about to change to change this cost benefits equation.


New tech exists that changes the equation. 

The new tech allow people to be compensated with money and to be confident they will not be exploited.

So when will the world change? This depends on the timing of three prereq conditions. 

Timing questions

- When will governments sign off on this new tech?
- When will consumers offer their PID on this new tech?
- When will enterprises invest in this tech?

For governments and people to sign off, they must have confidence in the money and security, and have a massive gain in better predictions.

The other question is, when will this technology be cheap enough for enterprises to invest?
Once an enterprise see their potential profits outweigh the costs they will invest in the new layer. 
The current blockchain technology exist but the cost is too high. 

What are the key cost factors for making a new blockchain enterprise PID layer? 

- Ethereum transaction costs must get much lower
- ZKP SNARK proof cost must be much lower


What is needed for the chain reaction to start?

The variable factor per industry sector is the massive variation in premium payments the customer is willing to pay for more granular predictions. So my guess is that the sector dealing critical life needs willm be the first to adopt the new tech.

- elderly autonomy
- mating
- avoiding death through customized medicine
