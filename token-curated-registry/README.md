Will a decentralized food certifier be superior to the existing centralized food certifiers?

A decentralized food certifier can be built using the concept of a Token Curated Registry (TCR).

Applications, such as the dishscores.com (ketoscore) would use the certs to replace or correct AI predictions.

Dishscores.com and other Dapps would be the interface by which people can both find certified dishes as well as challenge the certification.

Monetization is through big food enterprise company's paying to get certified food, and thus raising the token price.
