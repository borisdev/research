## Prompt Best Practices

- end question prompt with a ### to ensure the model does not predict a continuation 
- 'Say "I don't know" if you do not know the answer'
- high quality, diverse examples
- "The following answer is correct, high-quality, and written by an expert."
- "Let's think step by step" and "Give an  explanation of your reasoning before
  the final answer"
