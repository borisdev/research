# Pitch

Audience: Brad and Shawn

Intention: Boris is probing whether Shawn and Brad are attracted to the startup idea of creating a consulting firm to fine-tune LLM for big companies.


# Special timing

A few months ago, Sam Altmanâ€™s (CEO of OpenAI) expects that the next unicorn companies will focus on fine-tuning models for various verticals ([interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHoWGNQRXb0)).

In the last month, its clear that fine-tuning ChatGPT will make the most expensive components of an AI project obsolete.

- NLP experts working in NN architecture
- human annotation 

I predict there will be an AI arms race among business's that compete with one another.

But the big question is, Do we have sufficient evidence for a company's CTO to hire us over their own ML internal team or other consulting companies?

Here are some hypotheses.

- Its too early for there to be established consulting firms that fine-tune ChatGPT, ie. there is not much competition.
- The interest of a company's internal ML team is opposed to the new AI development model.
- The concept of an analyst-SME fine-tuning team does not yet exist at companies. See my paper here.
- An internal analyst-SME fine-tuning team will never be able learn as quickly as a consulting team that works with many clients. This depends on us developing a agile knowledge process.

What else is our special sauce? 

- We have talent and experience working with SMEs. 
- We have credibility with other CTOs and venture firms. 
- We can get a jump start on the competition because we don't have jobs.


What is the SME-analyst team?
