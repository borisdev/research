# Pitch

Audience: Brad and Shawn

Intention: Boris is probing whether Shawn and Brad are attracted to the startup idea of creating a consulting firm to fine-tune LLM for big companies.

A few months ago, Sam Altmanâ€™s (CEO of OpenAI) expects that the next unicorn companies will focus on fine-tuning models for various verticals ([interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHoWGNQRXb0)).

In the last month, its clear that fine-tuning ChatGPT will make the most expensive components of an AI project obsolete.

- NLP experts working in NN architecture
- human annotation 

A quick PoC will be the evidence to persuade CTOs that they must change their AI development model.

But the big question is, why would a company's CTO to hire us over their own ML internal team or other consulting companies to make a PoC?

Here are some hypotheses.

- A company's internal ML team will not propose make a PoC with the new AI development model because its against there interests.
- Its too early. There are no competing analyst-SME fine-tuning teams becasue the concept is too new. See my paper here. What is the SME-analyst team?

What else is our special sauce? 

- We have talent and experience working with SMEs. 
- We have credibility with other CTOs and venture firms. 
- We can get a jump start on the competition because we don't have jobs.
- An internal analyst-SME fine-tuning team will never be able learn as quickly as a consulting team that works with many clients. This depends on us developing a agile knowledge process.
