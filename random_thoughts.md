# Data side versus algorithm side 


- finding alpha - economic value from re-conceptualizing what the data means
- risky (engineering) versus frisky (data side)
- represent info value via data structure - simplification 
- enormous cognitive load up front to reduce long term load ...the sorting for BIG O problem for the human brain... 
- ROI
- Data design to reduce cognitive load and scale humans
- A computational model of human cognitive load

## The dilemna 

- questioning will come at the cost of the perception of execution speed at the beneift of avoiding the XY problem and making a Rube Goldeberg machine -- this will be hard without circumventing the conventional heirachy that instills fear to keep the perception of execution speeds high.
