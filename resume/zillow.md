## Zillow's eight values mapped to my mental model

Protocol for ROI judgement calls

- [ ] Turn On the Lights - Avoid XY problem, think big picture
- [ ] Customers Are Our North Star - Avoid XY problem, question ROI on the customer
- [ ] Think Big, Move Fast -- choose low-hanging business fruit 


Ethics at the individual level

- [ ] Own It - autonomy and accountability
- [ ] Do the Right Thing - ethics
- [ ] Deliver Quality on Time, Every Time -- hand-offs with low cognitive load 


Treat others with a balance of individualism and team work

- [x] Include and Empower - fairness, diversity, individualism, no tyranny of the masses
- [x] Better Together -- Interdependence, Team work
