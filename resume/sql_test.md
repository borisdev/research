Distance Per Dollar

Youâ€™re given a dataset of Uber rides with the traveling distance
("distance_to_travel") and cost ("monetary_cost") for each ride. For each date,
find the difference between the distance-per-dollar for that date and the
average distance-per-dollar for that year-month. Distance-per-dollar is defined
as the distance traveled divided by the cost of the ride.  


The output should
include the year-month (YYYY-MM) and the average difference in
distance-per-dollar for said year-month as an absolute value rounded to the 2nd
decimal. You should also count both success and failed request_status as the
distance and cost values are populated for all ride requests. Also, assume that
all dates are unique in the dataset. Order your results by the earliest request
date first. Source: stratascratch.com
