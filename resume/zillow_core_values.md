# Zillow in a nutshell

## Two phase history of product

- Phase 1:  Zestimate real estate prediction valuation service. Customer Journey starts with the Home search.
- Phase 2 (now):  real estate transaction service


## Zillow's eight values mapped to my mental model

1. Customers Are Our North Star - Avoid XY problem, question ROI on the customer
2. Turn On the Lights - Avoid XY problem, think big picture
3. Do the Right Thing - ethics
4. Own It - autonomy and accountability
5. Include and Empower - ???
6. Think Big, Move Fast -- choose low-hanging business fruit 
7. Deliver Quality on Time, Every Time -- hand-offs with low cognitive load 
8. Better Together -- Interdependence
